# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

### Deployed Contract Address
0xaC20D648fe4a613Ff0b2a98321ec9772bFFC0735
This smart contract was deployed on the goerli testnet using the Quicknode RPC
